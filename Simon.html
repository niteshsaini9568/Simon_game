    <p>How to Play:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Game Start: To start a new game, press the "Start" or "New Game" button.</li>
        
            <li>Game Sequence: Simon will play a sequence of colors and sounds. Pay close attention to the sequence, as you'll need to repeat it later.</li>
            
            <li>Your Turn: After Simon's sequence, it's your turn. Use the colored buttons (usually four) to repeat the sequence in the exact same order.</li>
            
            <li>
                <ol>Click or tap the buttons to repeat the sequence. For example, if Simon played Red, Green, Blue, you should click the corresponding buttons in the same order.
                    <li>Correct Sequence: If you correctly repeat the sequence, Simon will add another step to the sequence, making it one step longer.</li>
                    <li>Incorrect Sequence: If you make a mistake and don't repeat the sequence correctly, the game will end, and your score will be displayed.</li>
                    <li> Winning: The goal is to reach the highest level and the longest sequence possible. Challenge yourself to see how far you can go!</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
